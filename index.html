    <p class="_large">Welcome to the <em>Stack Overflow Careers Product UI Library</em>. Within this document you'll find base styles, components, and views relating to the Stack Overflow Careers project.</p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This library's purpose is to educate the Stack Overflow Careers team of the various methods available to them to achieve their various visual UI goals that help achieve a consistent, on-brand experience. In addition to an unified experience, this library will also help the team achieve the following subgoals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Eliminate code redundancy</strong> by leveraging current styles or extending them to achieve new modules or views while staying on-brand.</li>
      <li><strong>Propogate change more readily</strong> throughout the site.</li>
      <li><strong>Create a living document</strong> that other teams, internal or external, can review to give them guidance within their projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>The UI Kit requires that you use a single <code>.less</code> file to add to your <code>.less</code> files. Doing so will give you access to drop-in classes that will apply styles to common elements such as buttons, as well as access to a responsive grid system. You'll also get access to commonly used variables related to colors and type. Simply add this line to the top of your <code>.less</code> files:</p>

    {% highlight scss %}
        @import "lib/base.less";
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <p>Before writing code to contribute to the repository, think about what is being affected with the LESS you're writing. Because we've never done this before, it may be unclear where LESS should live based on its scope. As it stands, there are three tiers of scope that determine where the LESS should live.</p>

                <p>Should probably live in the UI Kit, so read below</p>
            </div>
            <div class="-col4">
                <p>Tech tags across Careers, Q&amp;A, etc. in the appropriate file within the UI Kit</p>
            </div>

    <h4>Graduating LESS</h4>
    <p>As a general rule, you should start with implementing your LESS in the smallest scope possible - almost always at the page level - then graduate that LESS as the scope expands. This is closest to how we develop LESS anyways.</p>
    <p>For example, I may create icons for industries on city pages, which is very specific to one feature of Careers. The relevant LESS would live in a page-specific <code>less</code> file like <code>citypages.less</code>, even if it <em>may</em> one day go to other parts of Careers. Perhaps after a few weeks, a new feature on Careers requires those industry icons. At this point, it's best to move the relevant code from <code>citypages.less</code> and into <code>shared.less</code> which is used across the Careers project. As a final stage, we may start thinking about using industry icons in Stack Overflow Q&amp;A profiles, and this is when you should put the relevant code into a pull request for the UI Kit.</p>
