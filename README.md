[Product Pattern Library](http://stackexchange.github.io/jam/)
=====

Welcome to Jam, the Stack Overflow Pattern Library. This is an active library that provides visual direction and syntax recommendations for Stack Overflow's LESS, CSS, and JS.

This is developed and maintained by the internal product team, but in the spirit of all things [**Stack Exchange**](http://www.stackexchange.com), we are publishing this resource externally in the hopes it's an inspiration and guide for your team as you create your own pattern library.
