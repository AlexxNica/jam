[Product UI Library](http://jonhmchan.github.io/uikit/)
=====

Welcome to the internal Product UI Library for Stack Overflow Careers. This is a living pattern library that provides visual direction and syntax recommendations for our LESS, CSS, and JS.

This is developed for our internal team, but in the spirit of all things [**Stack Exchange**](http://www.stackexchange.com), we are allowing others to take a peek at how we've tackled having an internal pattern library. We hope this resource can be an inspirationfor you and your team as you set up your own library.
