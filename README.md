Welcome to Jam, the Stack Overflow Pattern Library. This is an active library that provides visual direction and syntax recommendations for Stack Overflow's LESS, CSS, and JS.

This is developed and maintained by the internal product team, but in the spirit of all things [**Stack Exchange**](http://www.stackexchange.com), we are publishing this resource externally in the hopes it's an inspiration and guide for your team as you create your own pattern library.

=====

Welcome to the internal Product UI Library for Stack Overflow Careers. This is a living pattern library that provides visual direction and syntax recommendations for our LESS, CSS, and JS.

This is developed for our internal team, but in the spirit of all things [**Stack Exchange**](http://www.stackexchange.com), we are allowing others to take a peek at how we've tackled it internally. We hope this resource can be an inspiration for your team as you create your own pattern library.
